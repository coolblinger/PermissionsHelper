# Tested with RB [_1185_] (http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/1185/)
## Dependencies:
-   Plugins that support SuperPerms

## Notes:
-   This will only work with plugins that support SuperPerms, because it pulls the permissions from the plugin.yml files.

## Changelog:

__1.0.3__

> -   Made it compatible with the latest Bukkit build.

__1.0.2__

> -   Added a list of plugins that did not have permissions nodes included

__1.0.1__

> -   Added a dash in front of each permissions node

__1.0__

> -   Initial release
